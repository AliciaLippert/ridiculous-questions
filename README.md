## Tooltip Generator
> A tool to generate CSS code for tooltips

Do you urgently need a tooltip, but you are lazy to do it from scratch? There is a way out! This tool allows you to generate CSS and HTML code with a simple set of actions in the right sidebar that you can simply copy and paste ðŸ˜‰

I hope it will save you time!
